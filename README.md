Assignment 02
Instructions:
• This assignment is to be completed in groups.
• The due date until the next lecture time, submit what you have before next week's lecture. Late submissions will NOT be marked. (no excuse)
• The solutions must be submitted via Blackboard through the assignment’s link.
• Follow the accepted file format (PDF editable file (no images), the .ipynb file, and dataset.csv file)
• Any feedback/issue on the Assignment grades should be within a week after grading, a clear one email (use Blackboard email please).
• A zero-tolerance policy regarding plagiarism and cheating is in effect.


CASE STUDY: Select a dataset (e.g. from your workplace) any topics, then explore and summarize the data as follows: 

a. Which variables are quantitative/numerical? Which are ordinal? Which are nominal? (Nominal data is classified without a natural order or rank, whereas ordinal data has a predetermined or natural order). 

b. Compute the mean, median, min, max, and standard deviation for each of the quantitative variables.

c. Plot a histogram for each of the quantitative variables. Based on the histograms and summary statistics, answer the following questions: 
i. Which variables have the largest variabilities? 
ii. Which variables were seen skewed? 
iii. Are there any values that seem extreme? 

d. Plot a side-by-side boxplot comparing any two variables. Explain what this plot shows us. 

e. Compute the correlation table for the quantitative variable (method corr()). In addition, generate a matrix plot for these variables (Heatmap). 
i. Which pair of variables are most strongly correlated? 
ii. How can we reduce the number of variables based on these correlations? 
iii. How would the correlations change if we normalized the data first?

f. Apply of PCA for any two variables
